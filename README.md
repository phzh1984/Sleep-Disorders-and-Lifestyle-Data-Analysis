# Sleep-Disorders-and-Lifestyle-Data-Analysis

Overview

The Sleep Disorder Prediction Project is a data science initiative aimed at analyzing various lifestyle and medical variables to predict the occurrence and type of sleep disorders in individuals. Sleep disorders, such as Insomnia and Sleep Apnea, can significantly impact a person's health and overall well-being. By identifying individuals at risk of sleep disorders, this project intends to enable timely interventions and treatments to improve sleep quality and overall health.

Dataset Description

The project utilizes the "Sleep Health and Lifestyle Dataset," which comprises 400 rows (individuals) and 13 columns (variables) covering a wide range of information related to sleep patterns and daily habits. The dataset includes the following key features:

Comprehensive Sleep Metrics

This section allows exploration of various sleep-related metrics such as sleep duration, quality of sleep, and factors influencing sleep patterns.

Lifestyle Factors

The dataset provides insights into lifestyle factors such as physical activity levels, stress levels, and BMI categories, which may have an impact on an individual's sleep health.

Cardiovascular Health

Measurements of blood pressure and heart rate are included, crucial indicators of an individual's cardiovascular health that may correlate with sleep disorders.

Sleep Disorder Analysis

The primary focus of this project is to identify the presence or absence of sleep disorders in individuals. The dataset labels individuals with three categories in the "Sleep Disorder" column:

None: Individuals who do not exhibit any specific sleep disorder.

Insomnia: Individuals who experience difficulty falling asleep or staying asleep, leading to inadequate or poor-quality sleep.

Sleep Apnea: Individuals who suffer from pauses in breathing during sleep, resulting in disrupted sleep patterns and potential health risks.

Data Dictionary

Impact

By conducting this data science project, we aim to provide valuable insights into the factors influencing sleep disorders and develop a predictive model. This model can help identify individuals at risk of sleep disorders, thereby promoting better sleep health and overall well-being.
